  <p>Making Financial Decisions:</p>
<p>This game focuses on the management of day-to-day expenses. This is an opportunity to have a detached interaction with common life decisions, while learning about many personal finance concepts.<br>
  You will be presented with various scenarios and be required to make a decision. Each decision you make affects some aspect of your life, whether it is your wellbeing, your bank account, or both. The game is designed to make you think about how to balance life decisions. Everyone’s situation and priorities are different so we could never capture all possibilities. Nevertheless, we hope you enjoy this financial literacy experience. Good Luck and Enjoy!!!!
